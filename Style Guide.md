## Integration Hub specific terms and language - current
* the team responsible for an application or API is referred to as the 'owning team'
* the process of adding the details of an application or team to the Integration Hub for the first time is referred to as 'registering' (not 'creating' or 'generating' - these things already exist, the user is just telling us about them)
* credentials are 'generated' (not added/created/registered) 
* applications, credentials and teams are 'deleted' (not removed/unregistered)
* users are 'removed' from teams, and APIs are 'removed' from applications (not deleted, the user or API still exists afterwards we have just removed the association)
* we say 'your applications' and 'your APIs' to mean applications and APIs that are owned by a team of which the user is a member (no personal ownership is implied)
* we say 'your teams' to mean teams that the user is a member of, not just teams that the user personally created
* the live environment is referred to as 'production'. The collective term for all other environments is 'non-production'. 

## Integration Hub specific terms and language - suggested
* use 'search' when the results are ordered by relevance, use 'filter' when the order is unchanged. should we change the magnifying glass icon to a filter icon?
* are APIs registered, created, deployed or produced? (we use all 4 terms in different places)
* technical style guide suggests 'create/revoke' for API keys
